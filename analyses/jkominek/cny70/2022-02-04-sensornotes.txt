Put a CNY70 on a motorized stage, aimed at a white surface.
Moved it around, linearly, then at random, taking measurements
of the output. Phototransistor was fed into a TIA. High voltage
on the PT was 3.2584V. Reference voltage on the opamp was 1.9799V.
So there was 1.2749V across the phototransistor.

Voltages were measured with a EEVBlog 121GW multimeter.
Motion provided by a Creality Ender 3 V2.
Distances confirmed with Mitutoyo CD-6" ASX digital calipers.

All millimeters. Looks like the first column of the data needs -0.33
applied.  I think I was smashing the sensor into the target by 0.33mm.
Explains why it goes flat <=0.33

Maximum possible value for the raw data is ~1.9799V.

Gnuplot command for reasonable plot is
