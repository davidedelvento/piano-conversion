# About

This represents work on hardware/software for converting acoustic
pianos in to full featured MIDI controllers. The idea is to take
untunable pianos, or pianos whose restoration cost would wildly
exceed their value, and make something useful out of them.

Later work may expand that scope.

It was inspired by Evgeni Kumanov (CyberGene)'s "Cybrid" controller:

# Warning

Not only are the hardware designs unfinished, they have not been
fabricated, tested, or had firmware written for them.

See the [Status page](https://github.com/jkominek/piano-conversion/wiki/Status) for where things stand.

See [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/jkominek/piano-conversion/blob/master/DESIGN.md) for system design information.
