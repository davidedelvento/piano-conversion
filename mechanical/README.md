# Mechanical parts

Mechanical design is wholly outside the scope of this project.

There's too much variability in piano design, and personal aesthetics, for
a single mechanical design to be a productive goal.

But it can't hurt to put in some of the materials I've used. Most of them
will be OpenSCAD files, as the parts are simple, and OpenSCAD is available
to everyone. They might give you some ideas.

* odd_supports
  * Lets you make very complicated mounts to hold a dual slot 4040 extrusion up in the air at arbitrary angles, using two 2020 supports.
* cny70-protector
  * A plate to put over the CNY70 PCBs, which leaves the sensors exposed, while protecting them from direct hammer strikes.
* back-block & lr-block
  * Some simple blocks intended to mount onto single slot 4040 extrusions and hold the keybed from the side.
* mounting_plate
  * Adapter which holds my larger PCBs to the dual-slot 4040 extrusions.

More stuff will be forth coming.

# Sources of useful things

* Amazon is full of cheap hardware.
* McMaster-Carr, if you're not aware of it, will sell you just about every mechanical widget there is, for the right place.
* Misumi is my preferred supplier for aluminum extrusions. They'll cut and customize them for very reasonable prices, and are very precise.
